# About me
Hi, my name is Igor Matuszewski and I'm a software developer focused on video game programming.
Currently a student at University of Warsaw, Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics.
<br>Proud student for Google Summer of Code 2017, where I'm contributing to the [Rust Language Server](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls) project.

### Games

Responsible for all sorts of nefarious bugs in [Sniper Ghost Warrior 3](http://sniperghostwarrior3.com/), especially the save system, while I was working at [CI Games](http://cigames.com).
<br> Additionally created few small games in Unity3D, mostly for student assignments.
