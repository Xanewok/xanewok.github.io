title: Wrapping up work on the RLS for GSoC
category: draft
---
It's time to wrap up the work done on the RLS for this year's edition of Google
Summer of Code. Time surely flew fast since the [first blog post](
{% post_url 2017-07-06-working-on-rust-language-server-for-gsoc-2017 %})!

In general, the goal of the project was to improve the user experience and
IDE support story for Rust. Apart from the regular bugfixes and QoL changes, the
primary goal and biggest in terms of scope feature was to implement supporting
multiple package targets and packages in general, including Cargo workspaces.
Another one, a stretch goal of sorts, was to implement previewing macro expansion
in the editor, however, in the end, there was not enough time to pursue that.

At the time of writing, 2 out of 3 stages of workspace support has been implemented,
I managed to land [27 PRs](#most-notable-prs), push
46 commits (<span style="color:green">+2,637</span> insertions and
<span style="color:red">-1,139</span> deletions) in total.

### Work done for multiple packages and package targets
For supporting multiple crate targets, one of the most useful implemented features
is ability to specify which target (`[lib]` or which `[[bin]]`) should be analyzed
by the RLS, as well as supporting analyzing bin targets that require the lib from
the same package. Additionally, the RLS itself can now detect which target should
be analyzed, if the user didn't explicitly specify it in the configuration.

Furthermore, a new `workspace_mode` has been added. When under it, the RLS doesn't
panic anymore when analyzing Cargo workspaces and happily provides all the diagnostic
data from the compiler for all the packages inside (assuming files are saved on
the disk), if a specific package hasn't been explicitly specified by the user
via the `analyze_package` option.

The work for workspace support was split into 3 stages:
1. First one was to introduce
a new, separate mode, under which the RLS would not crash and provide very basic
diagnostics.
2. Second one was to improve both the performance and support by executing
the linked compiler and gathering diagnostics and analysis data, which drives the IDE
features such as goto def, from every package in the workspace.
3. Third one, the biggest,
was to create and store a dependency graph of units of work (compiler calls), which
would allow to improve the latency of the analysis and provide support for in-memory
modified files.

Currently, the two first stages are completed, with the third stage still being actively
worked on.

### Difficulties
One of the things I struggled the most with was giving correct estimates for the work
I was tasked with. Even though the planned work was clearly defined, I tried to
find a balance between doing the work on a bigger, planned feature and implementing
smaller QoL changes or fixes that did ease/allow some people usage of the RLS.
In the end it didn't go exactly as planned and I definitely see it as an area I
need to improve in.

Having more freedom over one's work is both good and bad. There are no strict
*dreadlines* looming over you, however it's easy to lose yourself if you don't
organize your own work yourself. When working on some side projects I sometimes
used organization tools such as Trello or good ol' Post-Its and in the end, I
think I should've used it for this project. I managed to do most of the planned
work, but I think this would allow me to focus better on the task at hand.

### Takeaways
Before I started working on an open source project, it seemed really daunting to
contribute to one. I'm not sure what's causing this, maybe it's stories about
traditional open source projects' core developers posting rants or aggressively
rejecting contributions.

However it turns out the open source community is very
welcoming and helpful, not only when you post an issue, but also when you want
to contribute as well. Explaining rationale, slowing down the pace to match
contributor's is very helpful and encourages to contribute to the project itself.
After all, the contributions are not only useful to yourself, but also to other
people in general.

I think I've been bitten by the OSS bug by now and definitely find myself
contributing to other projects thanks to working on one during the Google Summer
of Code.

### Closing words

It's easy to doubt yourself, whether one should even apply for GSoC because of
seeming lack of skill or whatever. However, one thing to keep in mind is that
the GSoC isn't some internship at a sweatshop, where you have to churn out code
as fast as possible to meet some impossible deadlines. Primarily, it's a valuable
opportunity with the focus on learning.
It shifts the way one thinks about the open source movement/projects and it helps
to grow as a programmer, both in terms of skill and communication required to do
the job.

I wholeheartedly recommend it and if there's a single thing I regret is that
I didn't do it sooner. If you find yourself thinking whether should you apply - **do it**!
You'll love every second of it.
