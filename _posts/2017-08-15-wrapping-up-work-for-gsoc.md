title: Wrapping up work on the RLS for GSoC
category: draft
---
It's time to wrap up the work done on the RLS for this year's edition of Google
Summer of Code. Time surely flew fast since the [first blog post](
{% post_url 2017-07-06-working-on-rust-language-server-for-gsoc-2017 %})!

In general, the goal of the project was to improve the user experience and
IDE support story for Rust. Apart from the regular bugfixes and QoL changes, the
biggest, in terms of scope and work, planned feature was to implement supporting
multiple package targets and packages in general, including Cargo workspaces.
Another, lesser, feature to explore was to implement previewing macro expansion
in the editor, however, in the end, there was not enough time to pursue that.

At the time of writing I managed to land 27/31 PRs, push 44 *(?)* commits (totaling
*(green)* +? insertions and *(red)* -? deletions) in total.

### Most notable PRs

* CI/Documentation (readmes etc.)
* Minor stuff (list each with PR)
* list all the stuff required for workspaces/multiple packages/targets
